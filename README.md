# Resale Auto Valuation Engine

## Overview
The **Resale Auto Valuation Engine** is a machine learning-powered tool designed to predict the price of used cars based on key features such as brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, and more. This project aims to assist individuals and businesses in making informed decisions when buying or selling used cars by providing accurate and reliable price estimates.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handles missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
  - Encodes categorical features using techniques like one-hot encoding.

- **Machine Learning Model:**
  - Built using Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.
  - Trained on a dataset of around 4000+ car records with diverse features.

- **Performance Evaluation:**
  - Evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
  - Achieved 0.8 R-squared score.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
  - Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn

- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook

## How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing:** The raw dataset undergoes cleaning and transformation to make it suitable for training a machine learning model.
2. **Model Training:** A predictive model is trained using the processed data.
3. **Prediction:** The trained model takes user inputs (car details) and predicts the resale price.
